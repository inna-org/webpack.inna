The project currently has 2 .js files. This is for demonstration purposes only. The only .js file you need for the build to work is 'index.js'. You can not change its name unlsess you edit webpack.config.js. If you don't know how to do that then just keep index.js named as is.

When Webpack runs it combines all .js files into app.js. app.js is linked within index.html so it runs when index.html is opened.
